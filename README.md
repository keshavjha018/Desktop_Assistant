- Sending E-Mails
- Weather report
- Telling Latest News
- Crawling to any website  (Based on Voice command)

- & many others.

Detailed description:


It can not only perform simple tasks like opening apps, websites, google search, showing weather, temperature, telling jokes, playing literally any song available on internet, taking screenshots and many more.


But is also capable of doing extensive and complex tasks like Voice typing, fetching weather data via API, answering any question via search engine API and web scrapping, sending mails to anyone* , joining class meet automatically based on your schedule & time zone, creating a new meet, telling exact location based on user’s IP, automating web browsers and many more. And that’s all without even touching the computer, just by Voice commands.


As of now we are still working on maximizing the tasks it can do and adding more and more functionality to it.
